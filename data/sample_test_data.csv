23 March 2012,tt0139239,ur24171148,True,"I see that this movie came out in 1999, but I don't remember it coming out on the big screens? I bought the DVD on Amazon and loved the movie, I guess because I am a huge William Fichtner fan. The movie is different in a way because it has three separate stories, involving four different character's from the movie. Even though there are three separate stories of the individual's it all connect's in the end. In the first story we have a Ronnin who is short on rent money and if she doesn't come up with something to make a quick money will be thrown out of her apartment. She hooks up with a drug dealer, she scores the cash, but D***S him over. When he finds out he shows up at a rave where she's at, he finds he and confronts her. Her story ends when she accidentally gets hit by a car.The next story is about Simion the British guy, who gets to go with his friends to Las Vegas. All is going well with his buds, until, he and Taye Diggs character decide to go to a strip club called The Crazy Horse.. Taye Digg's character warned him order anything U want except Champaign-means private dance.When the ladies come over to greet them Simon gets stupid and asks for the most expensive bottle of Champaign. Simon gets his private dance and more than he bargained for. The rules the girls can touch U but U can't touch the girls. The rule gets broken, things get out of hand and Simon pulls out a gun and shoots a bouncer. When this happens the whole gang gets involved and are trying to get the hell out of Vegas, because they are wanted. This was an OK story, but in reality very unrealistic.The third about Adam and Zack is the best, it's about to actor's who are used as pawns to catch a drug dealer in the act of selling. Adam and Zack go along with it because an offense will be expunged from their record if all goes as planned. They met up with Burke, a cop or ex-cop who still has connections to the department. We then realize the 1st and 3rd stories come together, in the end. Then the 2nd story ties in with some of the characters in the 1st story.I hope this review is helpful, it is hard to explain a movie like this. To me it is a good movie, to rent, or one to buy if the price is right. The only drawback it might have is yes it is unrealistic, but most movies are. This movie is one to watch when U had a hard day/busy one and just want to chill 4 about 2 hours.It does have it's comedic side to it, but for those that do not like several stories told in one movie, even though they all connect in the end; this would not be for you.

3 March 2012,tt0139239,ur27175177,True,"I seem to have been watching a number of good movies lately, but then again I generally do not like to watch movies unless they are good. As you have probably guessed, I though that Go was a pretty good movie, and it had more to do with it than myself thinking that two of the main female characters (or actually the blonde) were attractive.What is the plot you may ask? Well it is difficult to work out, with the exception of stating that it is about what a group of people do on Christmas eve. As to a singular plot, there isn't one, rather it is divided into three, and even then they do not have a singular goal. Simply put, it is the experiences of what people go through on this one night, the problems that they create and how they solve them.As my friend stated, Go is what Pulp Fiction should have been. It is made in a similar style to Pulp Fiction. The movie is divided into three sections, each of them stemming from one scene that occurs at the beginning of the movie, and these three sections deal with a different group of people. The first is about two girls who have been requested to get some ecstasy for a couple of guys, and then have to get rid of them because it is that or get caught by the cops, and then must try and get their collateral, which is actually one of them, back from the dealer.The second is about their friend, the guy who normally gets the drugs, and his trip to Las Vegas. There he runs out of money gambling, sleeps with two women at once, has to run from a burning building naked, shoots a bouncer at a sleazy club, and then escapes from Las Vegas after being chased by some nasty nightclub owners.The final one is about the two guys who wanted the drugs, and their adventures that night where they have to help the police catch a drug dealer, then go back to the guy's house for dinner, and then chase down the person who they had been sleeping with. Finally they all seem to tie together nicely, leaving the movie with the question of what they will do New Year's Eve.When trying to decide what this movie is, I concluded that it is a mix between a Quentin Tarrentino, Kevin Smith, and Australian made movie. It had a distinctly Australian feel about it, even though it was filmed in Los Angeles. The structure of the movie was distinctly Tarrentino, with dialogue that seemed to come straight from a Kevin Smith movie. The sound track was quite good as well.One thing this movie does is that it explores the more left wing American culture, as we travel with a number of people during that one night. We are left at times wondering what happened to people, and see how unexpected twists surprise us as to the nature of most of the characters. In the end though, we are left exhausted in the aftermath of what truly was an exciting night.",8,Adventures on Christmas Eve
24 August 1999,tt0139239,ur0235204,True,"GO bears some structural resemblance to PULP FICTION.  It's non-linear structure and it's drugs and violence subject matter make comparison inevitable, though there's considerably less violence and (spoiler) a Hollywood ending.  There's even a gun in a car scene that one fears will end in the same way it does in FICTION.  GO is enlivened by sharp editing and good performances by the ensemble cast. Cameo by Jane Krakowski (of TV's ALLY McBEAL) is all too short.  Director thankfully leaves audience to fill in some of the blanks, which makes this a film to ponder, even for the MTV set. Screenwriter neatly works the title word into the plot to surprising effect.  Go rent GO.  See GO rent.  Go GO go!",8,PULP FICTION GO Lightly
5 November 2009,tt0139239,ur17825945,True,"(Spoilers) When I first watched 'Go' many years ago, I thought it was just okay until one small scene set the intertwining story lines: As there are three main Christmas Eve stories going on here, in story #2, a character in Las Vegas calls another one (Todd, aka ""the good drug dealer"") in LA. We already saw Todd receive this call in #1. I was surprised for two reasons: I knew nothing about this movie (including the 3 different chapters) prior to seeing and when that was easy to figure that out, I didn't know they would be so interwoven. I loved this movie. I loved the music (fast and slow), I loved the originality, the acting by all actors Â– especially and namely Polley (this is the movie that made me fall hard for her, as an actress that is), the sets, the pacing, comedy, dialogue and simple craziness of everything going on. It was like a young adult version of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' or 'Seinfeld.' As mentioned, one Christmas Eve, grocery-store clerk Ronna inadvertently sets off a chain reaction between multiple lives while attempting to get enough money to avoid eviction the following day. That night is seen by various eyes and almost all intersects/overlaps with pure escapism, comedy, fun and ends up as the less-dreary LA 'Crash' story. I could go on and on about all the actors, they were all pure fun to watch, but probably the top picks would be Polley, Olyphant, Askew and Diggs. Also, even after 10 years since its release, the dialogue and facial expressions (namely from the repeatedly stunned Todd) still had me rolling. It's not perfect, but for a far-above average rave movie with an actual plot, as well as far-above average killer soundtrack, it's worth a ""go.""",9,Christmas Surprises
25 February 2006,tt0139239,ur6660225,True,"The film Go is about on how the whole movie takes place in a 24 hour period, and it focuses on 3 different point of views after watching the movie, I like it so much that I decided to watch the commentary to it I already thought of what the point to this movie is, after watching the commentary, it turns out that I was right The whole point to this movie is about young people making very risky decisions and somehow getting away with it. Film shows that life can be exciting if you want it to be.the movie is funny and exciting at the same time their was one scene that I thought was kind of stupid, which is why I didn't give it a 10, but a 9 is also a good rating too",9,the whole point
29 September 1999,tt0139239,ur0191545,True,"Since when is crime without punishment supposed to be funny?  This movie is just not funny. I have a great sense of humor, I like noire-comedies.  Doing drugs is just not funny! The contents of the movie are not good.  A bunch of kids, who cuss a lot,  doing drugs and are in the business of selling drugs. . .  They are cute kids, but they are losers.  I hope people do not think that everybody whom: (1) drives drunk, (2) sells drugs, (3) shoots at the police, (4)  accidentally runs over a pedestrian, is going to do all that and go back to work two days later is mistaken!  They will end up in jail where they belong, if not dead which might be the natural consequence of their behavior! I am an anti-drug person and against the glamorization thereof. It was a mistake to have rented this trash. Stay away from this one. The  movie has no redeeming qualities. I have written very few negative comments but it is impossible to stay silent in the mist of such profanity and immorality! Please do yourself a favor do not waste your time!",1,Spoiler Warning! It was a mistake to have rented this trash!  Stay away from this one.
3 October 2006,tt0139239,ur5023752,True,"The film without a doubt has traces of ""Pulp Fiction"" embedded in it, but a little ""Swingers"" and other films to it as well. All in all it's an entertaining movie that goes nowhere and ends without an epiphany for these characters. This film has multiple stories that all relate with one another in some form that does not try to be alternative and cool. It doesn't condescend to its audience and it's always one step ahead of itself. Sarah Polley (whom I never heard of at the time but follow her work now) was great; Katie Holmes wasn't quite Katie Holmes, and that was good (although she is probably so above this movie now that she's with Tom). William Fichtner was dope as the weird cop, but it was Timothy Olyphant who stole the show as the charismatic drug dealer (and you never ever hated him). I've read other comments and these people just take this thing TOO seriously! It's not the movie of 1999, it's not ""Pulp""- it's just ""Go"". I have this movie on DVD and heard Doug Linman's commentary: he sounds like he had too much fun making this. And it was sick watching this! I guess if I came in with some expectations I wouldn't hate it like so many others do on this site! But I did catch this movie on TV on New Year's Day, and they butchered it so much because of the perverse and profanity-rooted scenes. The movie was so f**cked-up that I didn't even enjoy it, hence, I was part of that same crowd at one point.",7,"""Pulp Fiction""-lite..."
28 November 2000,tt0139239,ur0256124,True,"This movie is a lame attempt at trying to be Pulp Fiction.  Only it lacked any real cajones, and was completely impossible in many points. SPOILER ALERT The drug dealer's character was a lame attempt at being a Samuel L. Jackson -type, only a skinny white boy with not even a tattoo to make him look tough.  And what was up with that 30 second ""take the shirt off and turn around while the music plays, then cut the music..."" crap?  Trying too hard, are we?And the whole set-up thing with the girl!  How dumb is she?  A) don't deal a lot of drugs to new people, B) when you show up, and there's a 3rd guy there, DON'T SELL THE STUFF, C)when they say they're out of o.j., JUST WALK OUT THE FRONT DOOR YOU CAME IN!  They can't make you stay!  Never would happen that way in real life.  Just lacked reality, and thus the ""drama"" was lost.Next, the strip-club thing.  1) a bouncer wouldn't be THAT upset that you used hands, I'm sure it happens all the time, they'd probably just throw you out on your ear.  2) THE BOUNCER wouldn't be armed?  3) a big truck slamming into the side of the car at that rate of speed would have killed them all, or at least moved the passenger door into the center of the car, killing the passenger.These are just two major things that blew the movie for me.  Add to it the fact that nobody could act, the flagrant use of drugs to appeal to kids and ""look cool"", the completely TOP 40 SOUNDTRACK (even from one year later the songs sound stupid and out of place... Macarena for Pete's sake?), and the wanna-be-Pulp-Fiction-but-I'm-too-weak editing style just made one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.I'm 22, and I hate what this movie makes my generation look like.  We're not that stupid, even those of us who deal or do dope.Nobody over the age of 16 should find this movie interesting.",1,making my generation look dumber
16 February 2014,tt0139239,ur3886859,True,"I got this movie around a year ago... yes it took me some time to watch it(which i did tonight). The reason is simple, i got it as part of my obsession for teen comedies. Yes the kind of Superbad, American Pie, College, Van Wilder and so on. I learn afterword on IMDb that it was actually not a comedy at all, more like a serious movie with a good scenario. I waited for he right occasion and i did tonight.So lets just say people where exactly true on IMDb and the cover arts are really misleading cause despise a few things in the middle, it ain't a comedy at all. I was really surprised when the movie cut back to the beginning after the Ronna's story. I was disappointed cause i was starting to like the story and was eager to know what would happen next to her. But then the Simon story happen and its clearly the most fun of the 3. It does have a bit of a teen comedy feel even tough its much more serious and dark but i wish that part would had last longer.Finally the third part with the actors was really forgivable... boring even to be honest, and its disappointing the movie pretty much end with it, adding only a little story conclusion at the end.So bottom line what can i say... i liked part of this movie, i didn't like others, i am NOT a fan of movies cut into pieces and showing different point of views a la Pulp Fiction, but at least this one was made so the story is unfold in order, unlike Pulp Fiction, which was hard to follow and boring to my own taste.I will say i am glad i finally watched it, had a ""good time"" but its going to the pawnshop with my next back of DVDs for sale... If i could put 6.5 on 10, i would, but the movie does not qualify to a 7 to me.",6,"Deceiving cover, not a bad movie but..."

22 August 1999,tt0139239,ur0323615,False,"Not bad, not bad at all.  I am a sucker for a film that plays havoc with the 'point a to point b' chronology.  Visiting the beginning of the story a number of times and using it as a springboard to jump into other character's POV was very reminiscent of 'Pulp Fiction'.  The characters are almost believable and Scott Wolf playing a gay guy is quite amusing.The story was good and the way I rate films is down to whether I would pay to see it again - and yes, I would. This one is worth a look.",9,Did somebody say 'Quentin Tarantino'?
18 August 1999,tt0139239,ur0419756,False,"I think this movie was under-appreciated by American audiences.  I thought it was a great Gen X Pulp Fiction and the soundtrack is awesome!  While a few of the characters were broadly drawn, the way the director manipulated time and perspective was great.",10,innovative and rockin'...I love Go!
29 August 1999,tt0139239,ur0151633,False,"I saw Go! as a knot with no bows - a very interesting look at how teenagers can get themselves into a tangle without any decoration at the end. The format was excellent and Sarah Polley looks and acts like a young Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction already?).Well, onto its parallels with Pulp Fiction, Go! reads like a younger sibling that's not quite smart enough or confusing enough to cream its elders but it is original all the same.The action is racy (as you would expect from something named Go!) and the comic bits are actually funny which makes it enough to be called a comedy/drama. There are two sides to every character - one shown from another's point of view, and then from their own. Everyone is both a hero and a victim in their own right which makes Go! an exciting ride. (Not taken literally, Simon).",8,a knot with no bows
15 August 1999,tt0139239,ur0411584,False,"A brilliant, fast paced, hilarious, suspenseful and twisted story of a drug deal that doesn't go exactly to plan. Perfect performances all round with a special mention to Scott Wolf in the BODY RECOVERY scene. Finally a movie with characters you actually care about. Doug Liman has made a movie capturing moments that fill the audience with a myriad of emotions. An example of this was the scene in the TESTAROSSA with the newly found gun, you were kept on the edge of your seat the whole time just waiting for something to happen.

I was surprised at how entertaining the film was for me.  And I would think that anyone between 16 and 35 would love it.  It is fast paced with many twists and turns throughout and lots of laughs.

8 August 1999,tt0139239,ur0100166,False,"Go is wise, fast and pure entertainment. Assembling an exceptional casting it turns this movie unforgettable.

20 July 1999,tt0139239,ur0392750,False,"Go is the best movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. I read some reviews and I noticed how many people compared ""GO"" to ""Pulp Fiction"". So, since I love ""GO"", I went to rent ""Pulp Fiction"" to see how much alike they were. To tell you the truth, they weren't that much alike. In my opinion, ""Go"" was much better. ""pulp Fiction"" was lacking a story, and it was confusing. ""GO"" on the other hand had a story, and was put together so it was less confusing. ""GO"" is clearly a great movie. Some parts were somewhat predictable, if you know film elements really well. The film was funny. I laughed so hard, and I usually hate comedies. But this was different. One of the best performances in the movie is by Tim Olyphant as Todd Gaines. I loved the scene between Todd and Claire in the living room. It's not just some teen movie, I went with my 40 year old aunt and she loved it. She laughed so hard. Mannie was really funny during his ecstasy kick. Okay, I'm rambling now, I just wanted to say ""Go"" was the best movie I've ever seen.",10,It's the best movie I've ever seen
11 June 1999,tt0139239,ur0349105,False,"Call this 1999 teenage version of Pulp Fiction whatever you want but please don't call it original. This is one of the worst Tarantino rip-offs I have ever seen. The first two stories are mindless and un-entertaining. The only redeeming value the movie had was some of the humor contained in the last story. I noticed that a lot of IMDB users have complemented the acting in this film; I have to disagree. The acting, especially among some of the younger characters, was either dry, silly, or overdone. 3/10",3,Haven't we seen this before?
3 May 1999,tt0139239,ur0156431,False,"Why was this movie made? No doubt to sucker in the family-rebelling MTV faithful, many of whom do not care about anything other than the exterior of a movie - in Go the story about drugs and sex, and the crude humor.  While the plot line of the movie is interesting, the unsympathetic and underdeveloped characters give us nothing to care about.What is most bothersome is that at the end of the movie nobody learns anything.  This movie would have been much better if it had a point.  It makes brief and ambivalent references to family life, but never really has the guts to develop its critiques.I guess what makes this movie so pathetic is that every character is like all the other characters.  What's worse, never in the film, not even at the climax, do any characters distinguish themselves. The four men in Vegas hardly differ at all, and the three convenience store workers are all the same. If you want to waste your 7 bucks on uninspiring and forgettable slop, Go is waiting for you.",2,Go doesn't go anywhere
