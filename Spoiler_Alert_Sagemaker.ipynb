    "We have created this notebook separately for two main reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. As we have seen our dataset before, it's quite large and eventhough we have managed to save it to S3 bucket, we weren't able to read the whole file in sagemaker notebook as we have limited resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Following to the first step, we decided to minimize our dataset which also helped us to balance the classes (spoiler vs not-spoiler review) at the same time. Now that we have managed to read the dataset, there was another blocking issue of computational power and latency during the preprocessing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reasons, what we have decided was to create two notebooks: One that will explain the whole process in one go and another to show how we circumvented our problem by handling the preprocessing steps in another notebook and deploy this notebook to show the rest of the steps. \n",

    "We hope we didn't make the whole process hard to follow. :)"
